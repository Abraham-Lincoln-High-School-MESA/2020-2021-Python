Welcome to the GitHub repository for the MESA Python coding. This houses and will store all the content, code, and work we will be doing for the 2020-2021 school year, so we can easily find and organize it.

Remember we will be using [Repl.it](https://repl.it) as our in-browser IDE to compile and run our Python's codes, and as our classroom as well, so make sure you have created your account.

You do not need to create a GitHub account as you already have access to the organization (view only) as it is set to public, and can either copy or download the code. However, you are welcome to do so if you want, and added to the organization.
